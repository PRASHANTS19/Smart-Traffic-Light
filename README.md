# Smart-Traffic-Light
Using Arduino,Algorithams

We used LEDs to demonstrate a particular sequence to form an actual traffic light controller system.

Targeted Problem : 
Indian roads without any supervision or guidance can lead to traffic conflicts and accidents. Traffic signals are required for an orderly flow of traffic. Nowadays, everyone prefers a personal vehicle. Hence, the number of vehicles on the road is increasing continuously, which results in traffic jams.

Present Status :
In many parts of our country there is an imperative need of traffic signals at most of the crossroads and due to the unavailability of traffic signals many lives are at stake. So, we need a cheaper and durable solution to this problem. It provides road safety, also helps to solve traffic in simple manners.

Our Contribution :
Using Arduino and minimal hardware we have tackled this problem in an efficient and cost effective way. We have designed a simple and easy to understand traffic light controller.

This project uses an Arduino and some LEDs to replicate a traffic light. It uses code as an internal timer and continues to run until you cut the Arduino's power supply.
